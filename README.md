# First Input Timer for Destiny 2

## Description
The First Input Timer is a custom overlay timer designed for speed runs in Destiny 2. It's built using AutoHotkey. The timer is triggered by specific in-game actions and can be customized through a settings GUI. It's made using my own overlay class which is not included in this repository.

## Features
- Customizable start triggers: Define specific game actions to start the timer.
- Overlay Display: Shows the timer on the screen with adjustable position and colors.
- Customizable Appearance: Change text color, font, size, and background settings.
- Settings GUI: An easy-to-use interface for configuring timer settings.
- JSON Configuration: Settings are saved in a JSON file for easy backup and transfer.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the GitHub releases page.
2. Run the 'First Input Timer' exe.

## Usage
- Start the timer by performing pre-configured actions in Destiny 2.
- Use the designated hotkey (default F2) to pause then reset the timer.
- The timer will not start again until it is fully reset by pressing the designated hotkey twice.
- Access the settings menu (default F3) to customize the timer's appearance and behavior.

## Possible Issues
- If your D2 installation is weird it may not be able to find your cvars file which will cause the program to exit.
